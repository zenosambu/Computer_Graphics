# First, a 10-second poll about this assignment period:

Did you go to exercise sessions? No

Did you work on the assignment using Aalto computers, your own computers, or both? Own computer

# Which parts of the assignment did you complete? Mark them 'done'.
# You can also mark non-completed parts as 'attempted' if you spent a fair amount of
# effort on them. If you do, explain the work you did in the problems/bugs section
# and leave your 'attempt' code in place (commented out if necessary) so we can see it.

           R1 Calculating joint positions (1 p):  done
                   R2 Rotating the joints (2 p):  done
  R3 Visualizing joint coordinate systems (2 p):  done
       R4 Skeletal subspace deformation (4 pts):  done
                R5 Skinning for normals (1 pts):  done

# Did you do any extra credit work? No
(Describe what you did and, if there was a substantial amount of work involved, how you did it. Also describe how to use/activate your extra features, if they are interactive.)

# Are there any known problems/bugs remaining in your code? No

# Did you collaborate with anyone in the class? 

Yes, I talked with Giuseppe Spallitta and Francesco De Sio.

# Any other comments you'd like to share about the assignment or the course so far?

(Was the assignment too long? Too hard? Fun or boring? Did you learn something, or was it a total waste of time? Can we do something differently to help you learn? Please be brutally honest; we won't take it personally.)
